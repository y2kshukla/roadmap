      desc: `In order to plan your sales funnel strategy effectively, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of your target audience. Attempting to target two distinct audiences simultaneously is not advisable.
      A sales funnel strategy is essential for maintaining a steady flow of leads and sales during your launch and for any evergreen programs or courses.
      Essentially, a sales funnel refers to the journey of converting a stranger into a customer. A sales funnel should ideally include a lead magnet or freebie landing page to grow your email list and generate leads, a low-ticket front-end offer sales page, a mid-range offer sales page, and a high-ticket offer sales page.
      However, it is not necessary to market all of these offers. Instead, you can launch the low-ticket/mid-range program and then upsell the customers for the other higher-priced offers. The primary objective is to provide value to potential customers before requesting a higher amount. It is important to connect all of your offers, from the freebie to the high-ticket offer, and determine which offers need to be marketed at each step, depending on your industry.`
